        <h3>In this section we talk about animals</h3>
        <p>
            Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form
            the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals
            consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, 
            can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells,
             the blastula, during embryonic development.

        <h3>In section2 we talk about birds</h3>
        <p>Birds are vertebrates (animals with backbones) with wings and feathers. ... But a few bird species do not have strong enough wings to fly, and so these birds are flightless. Birds' bodies are covered with a light, tough layer of feathers and they have very light skeletons.</p>
        <h2 id="human">Humans</h2>
        <h3>In section1 we talk about human</h3>
        <p>A human is a member of the species Homo sapiens, which means 'wise man' in Latin. Carolus Linnaeus put humans in the mammalian order of primates. Humans are a type of hominid, and chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans are their closest living relatives. Humans are mammals. They are also social animals.</p>
        <h2 id="space">Space</h2>
        <h3>In section4 we talk about space</h3>
        <p>Space is a hard vacuum, meaning it is a void containing very little matter. The space between galaxies is not completely empty but has an average of one atom per cubic meter. There are an estimated 100-400 billion stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way.</p>
